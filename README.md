### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create an account so that I can track future stats
    - This is done when I am able to create an account with email, password, and password confirmation form fields
- As a user, I want a log-in button so that I can log into my created account
    - This is done when I am able to log in through the email and password form fields and clicking log-in button
    - If credentials are not matched, reset field(s) and show log-in error
- As a user, I want the game board screen to show when logged in so that I move away from the log-in screen
    - This is done when a game board screen is shown
- As a user, I want the game board to be interactive so that I can play TicTacToe
    - This is done when the game board can be played against a player
- As a user, I want the winner of the game to be displayed so that I know who won
    - This is done when the appropriate player's name shows as winner upon being in a winning state
